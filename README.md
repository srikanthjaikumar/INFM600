Description

The new dataset namely "Optimal Locations for Wi-Fi Implementation in Howard County, MD" 
is created by joining datasets on Tourism and Cell Towers in Howard County, Maryland. 
This dataset will prove useful to address the question of – Which locations, most frequented 
by tourists can Wi-Fi service be implemented in using an existing Cell Tower?.The results 
for this analysis would be best represented using a map as geographic location is the 
primary attribute in this analysis. On the map, we can show towers that depict the location 
of a cell tower and draw a dotted circle around the same to represent area of coverage. 
The most common tourist spots will then be depicted using pins on the map. This would 
provide us with a clear representation of the maximum number of tourist spots that fall 
within the range of a tower which would result in locations that are most viable to 
implement Wi-Fi technology.

This dataset has been generated according to the specifications for class
INFM600, Fall 2015 at the University of Maryland, College Park.
